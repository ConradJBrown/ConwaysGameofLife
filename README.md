# ConwaysGameofLife
	This program is used to simulate Conway's Game of life 
	The program will take in 3 arguments
	the first for the size of the 2D array
	The second to tell it how many iterations is will do
	The third will be whether you want it to be a Random or a Glider
	After you give the arguments (E.G java Life 100 200 R) 
	it will open a seperate window displaying the Game of life simulation
# How it works
	The program will take an argument and run a similation of how the cells would operate 
	using the definition of conways game of life
	Rules:
		Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
		Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
		All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
